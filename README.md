## About

Unity Tiny Builder is a build automation utility designed to streamline the Android build process for Unity projects. This tool helps developers automate repetitive build tasks while maintaining clean, maintainable code. Developed with respect for [Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobjects.org/)

> **Note**: Currently in development and supports Android builds only. iOS support is being considered for future releases.

## Features

- **Smart File Naming**: Automatically generates build files with the format `ProjectName_[version]` (e.g., `ProjectName_1.0.1`) following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- **Flexible Naming Options**: Add custom prefixes and postfixes to build file names
- **Multiple Build Types**: Support for both APK and AAB formats - build separately or together
- **Version Management**: Automatically increment build/patch numbers
- **Configuration Management**: Create and manage configuration files for consistent builds
